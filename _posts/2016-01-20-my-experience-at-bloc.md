title: My Experience at Bloc
---

The end of this month marks my completion of the Bloc io Ruby on Rails web development bootcamp. Starting this course was kind of a shot in the dark: Would it benefit me? Will I like it? What can I do with it later in a non-traditional tech role?

My fears were pretty quickly realized at the start. Bumps of my past employer, not jiving with my first mentor, etc. As the course progressed I really wanted to enjoy it and get the most I could out of it. A major shift came after being laid off from my last company. The situation was do or die, so I came up with a plan of action.

The best steps I took for this course included changing mentors, bumping up the course pace, and worrying less while learning more.

Bloc, along with my awesome mentor, has given me greater understanding of web development and the confidence to keep this ball rolling.
